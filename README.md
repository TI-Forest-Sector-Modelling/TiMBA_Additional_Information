# README: Data Extraction and Calculation for Ad Valorem Tariffs Rates and Forest Growing Stock and Forest Stock Growth for TiMBA 


## Overview

This dataset serves as a guide for understanding how the ad valorem tariffs used in TiMBA - a partial economic equilibrium model for the global forest products market were generated and updated based on the WTO's tariff data. Further, this dataset contains information on forest growing stock and forest stock growth for 180 countries, as considered in the TiMBA model. The data are essential for modelling scenarios on forest development and trade flows.
By following the explanations outlined in the respective manual (Scenario_input_data_generation_Tariffs_Forest), we ensure transparency, accuracy and consistency in mean ad valorem tariff calculations as well as forest growing stock data and annual changes across the products and countries listed. For any further details, the tariff and forest data can be accessed directly through the provided database sources.
Data are provided in two tables: (1) AdValoremRates.csv and (2) ForestGrowingStock
